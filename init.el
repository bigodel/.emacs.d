;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Most (if not all,) of this configuration was inspired/copied from Bailey
;; Ling's Emacs configuration, found on https://github.com/bling/dotemacs
;;
;; NEXT: flyspell!!!
;; TODO: separate the configuration for languages in the langs folder and also
;; don't forget to wrap it on (after 'XXX-mode)
;; TODO: add config-aux-modes for modes that don't require config only install
;; TODO: check if whithout the provide's it makes it faster
;; TODO: changed all dotemacs-bla constants to bla
;; TODO: add a comment to all non-local variables
;;; Code:
;; some common lisp functions

;; we wrap our whole initializatino inside this let because we set some

;; a variable to store the location of our config outside of the initialization,
;; that's why it is also inside the let. and i also create a constant to store
;; the original value of the gc-cons-threshold while initing Emacs.
;; TODO: maybe wrap setq's or setvar's for the original value of these variables
;; in a (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook) and see how much init time we gain
