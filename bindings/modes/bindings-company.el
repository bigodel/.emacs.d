;; note that i use <tab> and TAB. that is because <tab> is for window Emacs and
;; TAB is for terminal Emacs. it might be the case that TAB ecompasses both, but
;; I don't want to test it :P. the dolist snippet of code i got from this post:

;;; Code:
(after 'company
  ;; bindings that are used when company is activated
  (bindings-define-keys company-active-map
    ((kbd "C-n") #'company-complete-common-or-cycle)
    ((kbd "C-p") (bind (company-complete-common-or-cycle -1)))
    ((kbd "<tab>") #'company-complete-selection)
    ((kbd "TAB") #'company-complete-selection)
    ((kbd "<return>") #'company-complete-selection)
    ((kbd "RET") #'company-complete-selection))
  ;; <return> is for GUI Emacs; RET is for terminal Emacs
  ;; (dolist (key '("<return>" "RET"))
  ;;   ;; here we are using an advanced feature of define-key that lets
  ;;   ;; us pass an "extended menu item" instead of an interactive
  ;;   ;; function. doing this allows RET to regain its usual
  ;;   ;; functionality when the user has not explicitly interacted with
  ;;   ;; company.
