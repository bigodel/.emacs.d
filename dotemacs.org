This is my personal Emacs configuration and probably will not be suitable for
anyone else's use, since it is highly tailored to what I prefer. That said, most
of what you may encounter here was heavily inspired, or blatantly copied, from
other people's configuration, and my Elisp skills aren't much better than a
beginner level, so feel free to copy whatever you might find on this repository
and incorporate it to your personal configuration.
